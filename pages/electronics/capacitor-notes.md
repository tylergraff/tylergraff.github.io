## Capacitor Notes

### Types
- Aluminum Electrolytics
    - **Designed to last 1K to 10K operation hrs at rated voltage, temperature, and ripple current**
    - Large capacitance values (1uF - 100,000uF)
    - Poor tolerance (often +80%/-20%)
    - High capacitance drift with age
    - Typical 15 year life due to evaporating / leaking electrolyte
    - 2X life increase for every 10°C below rated temperature

- Solid Tantalum
    - **Will explode if polarity is reversed**
    - Generally superior to 0.1uF - 100uF aluminum electrolytics
    - +/-20% or better tolerance
    - Low temperature coefficient, low age drift
    - Indefinite lifetime at 50% rated voltage and 3R series resistance

- Ceramic (MLCC)
    - **Capacitance decreases significantly with increasing voltage**
    - Typically Very Low ESR (< 1 Ohm in 1kHz range)
    - NP0 types exhibit low temperature coefficient, other types are worse
    - May couple mechanical vibrations into electrical signal ("microphonic")

- Polyester Film (PET)
    - General-purpose and high voltage
    - moderate temperature stability: 400±200ppm/°C
    - "Self-Healing" from high-voltage transients
    - Moderate age drift (due to moisture absorbtion)

- Polypropylene Film (PP)
    - Generally superior to PET
    - High temperature stability: 200±100/°C
    - "Self-Healing" from high-voltage transients
    - Low age drift (low moisture absorbtion)
